# Simple_Notes_Android_Java_App
My first app. Simple Notes is a note taking app which allows you to save text and secure your notes. WORK IN PROCESS INCOMPLETE
Started in mid August 2020 

This app was made using Java programming language

When you first opened the app you are presented with a list of folders that you've created or will create. On the bottom right corner there is a Floating Action Button
that if you click it will open a popup window allowing you to create a new folder. Currently that format that the folders are presented is a Grid view style. If you click
on a folder you will go to a similar page but it will be filled with a bunch of notes pages that you created. Similar to making a folder; if you click the Floating Action
Button it will help you create a new notes page. If you click an existing notes page; you have the option to edit the page, or save and share as PDF or txt file. You can also 
sort the folders/notes by date created, date modified, or alphabetical order. You can also delete individual folders (which will delete all the notes existing within) or delete 
notes pages themselves. One unique feature in the app is that you are allow to lock a folder with a passcode system. If you click the folder or attempt to delete the folder it will
popup a window asking you to enter the passcode that you entered yourself. This allows the folders to be secure from others if you wished to do so.

Saving and editing notes and folders and having a unique passcode is done using SQLite database.
The app also request permission allowing the user to share and save files
